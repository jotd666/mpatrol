- write letter to 83DE: write into another buffer, then blit it at the proper location
  when blitting ground strip
- end section letter written at the end of the strip
  
- tip of brown rocks can be blue on slopes..: use sprites for rocks / rolling rocks
  if jeep is not exploding
- demo section out of sync jeep falls into second hole! then continues
- save highscore & best course times
- custom2 bit jump with button 2 only
- start lives is wrong
- OCS: ground not working properly???
- borderblank ECS issue: maybe WinUAE problem??
- update_bg_tile tweak to only copy last plane for some tiles (ground)
- sprite allocation fail: low/high in message
- still floor tile missing after a slope
- missile: (champion course point A): missing front part or even complete missile
  if ships still in the sky when reaching point A: ships should go away earlier,
  game can't handle that (not a display issue, more a game sequence issue, like in demo)

AGA:

- add city layer: missing black color, redefine yellow, height issue, 
   erase issue!
- dual playfield with characters on top except for lower strip
- full bitplanes for ground strip (moonbase)

converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
