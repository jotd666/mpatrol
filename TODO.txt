- car body coords completely off, wheels seem ok
- lockup on "insert coin" screen, typing effect seems
  not to work


tricks:


- dual playfield: all 3 layers of ground, green & blue together, no scroll
- update green & blue not all the time (slow scroll)
- all bobs on the other plane
- sprites to complete the missing colors: map colors carefully
