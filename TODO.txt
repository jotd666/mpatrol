- mountain displayed lower: erase upper line (using cpu clr.l while blitting is probably ok)
- set rock color (using same color as mountain dark blue should be tweaked if terrain_height_in_tiles_E514 is high
- change dark brown color position so shots appear whiter on black
- update_bg_tile tweak to only copy last plane for some tiles (ground)
- optimize code by adding osd_w_videoram_no_update if followed by osd_w_colorram
- 50Hz hardware sprites

- toggle 25Hz if ECS, maybe 50Hz if AGA with fmode=3 and fastmem?
- queue_sound_effect_if_game_playing_0d75: game status bits not set properly!
- after the flat section after rising slope (point R), when nb slope
  tiles change, rightmost scrolling tile is buggy, looks like
  a rodent's head or something... Same when mines...
- continue screen timer doesn't work properly: time goes to 0 immediately, cannot continue
- check hole-making ship animations, look odd: probably flipx
- save highscore & best course times
- vertical shot: tile, not sprite, conflicts with background: try to make a special
  case to erase & update only upper bitplane (special erase char or clut to define too)

- implement flipx int flipx = m_spriteram[offs + 1] & 0x40;
- check flipy??

- space plant flipx space plant in general looks hard to draw: snapshot the game at this point
- city layer: missing black color, redefine yellow, height issue, erase issue! ATM put mountain again
- explosion which creates hole: right part looks wrong	

- insert coin screen: color bands not removed


- (c) IREM not properly displayed
- when title displays (moon patrol), completely loses real time in cycle exact
  probably needs complete rethinking of what's done here / use backbuffer
  blitter refresh.
- small transparency effect on the tip of the "l" of "Moon Patrol" => BOGUS TITLE NOW

low pri:  
  
- re-set tiles palette at some low Y so letters have proper palettes
- declare tiles & cluts manually (with playfield info) to save memory
- optim: maybe only 2 planes could be needed for uniform ground
  (but there are letters...)


converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
