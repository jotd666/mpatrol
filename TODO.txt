general:

- save highscore & best course times
- start lives is wrong, anything not default makes 4 lives + 1 coin => 6 credits
- game is 10% slower than it should be. Adding extra call each 10 calls adds
  nothing but more problems (demo not in sync, title not in sync, who knows what?),
  and copper mid-screen interrupt system not working ATM. CIA hooks don't work either
- try CIA clock again, but with graphics update (copper) blocking all interrupts
- still floor tile missing after a slope
- 99 credits after a while continuing

ECS:

- highscore temporarily erased on section score screen
- "TIME" not displayed sometimes
- tip of brown rocks can be blue on slopes..: use sprites for rocks / rolling rocks
  if jeep is not exploding

AGA:

- slowdowns chip only when UFOs attacking maybe use 30FPS too for BOBs in that case
- "game over" should be displayed on front layer (on mountains)

converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
