- ufo crashing: wrong x speed (too high)
- hole making bombs: not displayed: check cluts, but create holes!!
- ships not appearing is this a double buffering issue / try with immediate blitter: OK!!!
- a lot of wrong clut yellow flashes
- sorry no bonus! even if time below current best time
- wheels bouncing when jeep explode: 2 outer wheels bounce y is wrong
- insert coin OK but start game doesn't display moonbase, starts immediately like if it continued
  (which is cool to test!!) continue flag must be tested wrong: break in course_start_1311
- continue screen timer doesn't work properly
- after section E should be moon city and doesn't work
- slope sections don't work properly: scrolling stutters, no slope tiles appear (demo)


graphical issues:

- insert coin screen: color bands not removed
- multiplex sprites with 2 sprite control copperlist zones (materialize it
  to debug): lower zone already busy with jeep+wheels (6 sprites, all color banks), upper zone
  would contain ufos
- reuse 2 blue mountain colors for 2 lower scenery colors (rocks woulc be ideal!)
- remaining color bands (from start platform)
- rock colors are wrong
- moonbase colors not properly displayed
- 8373 contains 8C: use tiles palette, if not then switch, so moonbase has proper colors
- re-set tiles palette at some low Y so letters have proper palettes
- demo: moonbase displayed with trashed colors

solved if dual playfield used:
- vertical shot: tile, not sprite, conflicts with background
- (c) IREM not properly displayed
- when title displays (moon patrol), completely loses real time in cycle exact
  probably needs complete rethinking of what's done here / use backbuffer
  blitter refresh. Rest of game seems to run OK! Would require back to dual playfield!
  (object erase need mountains redraw at 50 fps which is probably too much)
- optimize bob erase below a given Y or within a given Y range
  (mountains erase, scrolling gound erases)
- small transparency effect on the tip of the "l" of "Moon Patrol" => BOGUS TITLE NOW

low pri:  
  
- declare tiles & cluts manually (with playfield info) to save memory
- optim: maybe only 2 planes could be needed for uniform ground
  or maybe even one (but there are letters...)


converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
