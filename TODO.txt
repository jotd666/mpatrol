general:

- save highscore & best course times
- custom2 bit jump with button 2 only
- start lives is wrong
- game is 10% slower than it should be. Adding extra call each 10 calls adds
  nothing but more problems (demo not in sync, title not in sync, who knows what?),
  and copper mid-screen interrupt system not working ATM. CIA hooks don't work either
  but try it and see if title & demo work, if it does, then ok!
- still floor tile missing after a slope
- 99 credits after a while continuing
- shell to start version according to chipset + whdload ocs:
  * OCS: OK
  * ECS/AGA: detect ECS version but with mountain cookie cut so green leaves a trace!


ECS:

- ECS version borderblank is gone even for AGA (whdload?)
- highscore erased on section score screen
- "TIME" not displayed sometimes
- tip of brown rocks can be blue on slopes..: use sprites for rocks / rolling rocks
  if jeep is not exploding
- update_bg_tile tweak to only copy last plane for some tiles (ground)
- colon not going away after end section screen: merge changes from AGA code (also to OCS code)

AGA:

- moon city: display it a few pixels higher? (slope bitplane pri conflict): to test
- point R: going up/down slope, blue flashing line
  do not set blue color if green y is above, set green
  instead

- slowdowns chip only when UFOs attacking
  maybe use 30FPS too for BOBs in that case
- shots are blue, should be white, swapping bob colors doesn't work!!!
- missing dyn color for plant, maybe not needed as we have 1 spare bob color
- "game over" should be displayed on front layer (on mountains)
- scrolling letters have wrong color (same as static MAME, but different
  from in-game rendering we'll have to hack the clut)
- last scrolling letter (E,J...) remains on bottom of screen
- "you have broken a record" bottom truncated!

converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
