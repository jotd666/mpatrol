check sprite shadow ram

try to implement scroll with copperlist (only lines 192-256 scroll): there are probably 4 scroll registers with 16 lines each


tricks:


- dual playfield: all 3 layers of ground, green & blue together, no scroll
- update green & blue not all the time (slow scroll)
- all bobs on the other plane
- sprites to complete the missing colors: map colors carefully
