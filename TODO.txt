- wheels move but all wheels have the same Y
- when "moon patrol" title is displayed, jeep is too low / jump looks bogus
- 0f0d: implement (in-game)
- insert coin screen: color bands not removed
- insert coin OK but start game doesn't display moonbase, starts immediately like if it continued
- write_to_screen_03c9: eats first character ("I" of "INSERT COIN"

- (c) IREM not properly displayed
- small transparency effect on the tip of the "l" of "Moon Patrol" => BOGUS TITLE NOW
- ground scrolling is off, with holes
- moonbase not properly displayed, completely trashed (colors probably
  wrong too): display_moon_base_0c42
  
low pri:  
  
- declare tiles & cluts manually (with playfield info) to save memory


tricks:

- use bobs palette for playfield (after status bar)
- "moon patrol" title displayed: switch to tiles palette for 8 first colors
