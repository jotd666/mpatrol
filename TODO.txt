general:

- save highscore & best course times
- start lives is wrong, anything not default makes 4 lives + 1 coin => 6 credits
- still floor tile missing after a slope

ECS:

- highscore temporarily erased on section score screen
- "TIME" not displayed sometimes
- minor: tip of brown rocks can be blue on slopes..: use sprites for rocks / rolling rocks
  if jeep is not exploding

AGA:

- slowdowns chip only when UFOs attacking maybe use 30FPS too for BOBs in that case

converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
