general:

- floppy Y sprite position is perfect but whdload: shifted by 1 or 2 !!!
  (for all versions OCS/ECS/AGA)
- minor: sometimes still floor tile missing after a slope (maybe normal?)

ECS:

- minor "TIME" not displayed sometimes (continue screen)
- minor: tip of brown rocks can be blue on slopes..: use sprites for rocks / rolling rocks
  if jeep is not exploding

AGA:

- minor: slowdowns chip only when UFOs attacking maybe use 30FPS too for BOBs in that case

converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
