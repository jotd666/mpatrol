- champion panel missing tile cluts
- implement flipy (commented blitz atm) hole making ufos
- implement flipx for bobs (ATM only for sprites)
- optimize code by adding osd_w_videoram_no_update if followed by osd_w_colorram
- continue screen timer doesn't work properly: time goes to 0 immediately, cannot continue
- queue_sound_effect_if_game_playing_0d75: game status bits not set properly!
- declare tiles & cluts manually (with playfield info) to save memory: almost ok
  missing ":" and quotes (yellow/black)
- custom2 bit jump with button 2 only
- add platform at startup even if mono-planar: merge all planes for those tiles
- points awarded: 500 points wrong clut...
- update_bg_tile tweak to only copy last plane for some tiles (ground)
- loop sfx + music issue (ptplayer)

- toggle 25Hz if ECS, maybe 50Hz if AGA with fmode=3 and fastmem?
- after the flat section after rising slope (point R), when nb slope
  tiles change, rightmost scrolling tile is buggy, looks like
  a rodent's head or something... Same when mines...
- save highscore & best course times

- check flipy??

- space plant flipx space plant in general looks hard to draw: snapshot the game at this point
- city layer: missing black color, redefine yellow, height issue, erase issue! ATM put mountain again
- explosion which creates hole: right part looks wrong	

- insert coin screen: color band not removed


- (c) IREM not properly displayed + small transparency effect on the tip of the "l" of "Moon Patrol"
=> redraw more tiles!!!


low pri:  
  
- re-set tiles palette at some low Y so letters have proper palettes


converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
