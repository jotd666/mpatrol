- access fault when displaying ufos hardware sprites (and ovoid UFO crashing on player)
- champion cheat: car becomes pink sometimes
- 68000 test: crashes after first section in the middle of an instruction: re-test
  debug with chip slave
- 10000 points bonus carry issue 10 of 10000 is trashed!
- dying & resuming with different mountain height! should erase blue mountain
  if previous y - y > 1 we should use blitter to clear zone or just
  better: clear top of screen if ground strip not moving
  
- demo section continues even if killed until game over then continue!!!
- champion panel still missing tile cluts! trans_color function working???
- custom2 bit jump with button 2 only
- loop sfx + music issue (ptplayer)
- start lives is wrong
- save highscore & best course times
- colons not erased: erase all planes when switching to mountains

- write letter to 83DE: write into another buffer, then blit it at the proper location
  when blitting ground strip
- cycle exact: rock sprites sometimes blink
- sometimes typewriter text effect freezes on a letter, then resumes


- city layer: missing black color, redefine yellow, height issue, erase issue! ATM put mountain again

- (c) IREM not properly displayed + small transparency effect on the tip of the "l" of "Moon Patrol"
=> redraw more tiles!!!

low pri:

- optimize code by adding osd_w_videoram_no_update if followed by osd_w_colorram
- points awarded: 500 points wrong clut/wrong transcription because black color
  in sprite => set in background, OK as BOB
- update_bg_tile tweak to only copy last plane for some tiles (ground)
- sprite allocation fail: low/high in message

converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
