- jeep killed as soon as rock appears (debug ground_objects_collision_checks_1699???)
  => compare behaviour of original / 68k routine when rock appears!
- rogue writes outside sprite registers (related to above?)
- during demo, jeep is killed almost at once
- insert coin screen: color bands not removed
- insert coin OK but start game doesn't display moonbase, starts immediately like if it continued
- continue screen timer doesn't work properly
- horizontal shots not registering/displayed

graphical issues:

- (c) IREM not properly displayed
- small transparency effect on the tip of the "l" of "Moon Patrol" => BOGUS TITLE NOW
- moonbase colors not properly displayed
- 8373 contains 8C: use tiles palette, if not then switch, so moonbase has proper colors
- re-set tiles palette at some low Y so letters have proper palettes
- demo: bogus blocks (big hole looks ok)
- demo: moonbase displayed with trashed colors
- vertical shot: tile, not sprite, conflicts with background

low pri:  
  
- declare tiles & cluts manually (with playfield info) to save memory
- optim: maybe only 2 planes could be needed for uniform ground
  or maybe even one (but there are letters...)


converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
