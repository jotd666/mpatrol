- queue_sound_effect_if_game_playing_0d75: game status bits not set properly!
- after the flat section after rising slope (point R), when nb slope
  tiles change, rightmost scrolling tile is buggy, looks like
  a rodent's head or something... Same when mines...
- continue screen timer doesn't work properly: time goes to 0 immediately, cannot continue
- check hole-making ship animations, look odd
- save highscore & best course times

graphical issues:

- convert ship to bobs if too many of them: 4 of each category max!
- convert ship to bobs when crashing on player (Y too high conflicts with lower sprites)
- optimize blit/erase height there are a lot of small objects! (dig out Xevious
  autocrop code)
- space plant symmetry??? space plant in general looks hard to draw: snapshot the game at this point
- city layer: missing black color, redefine yellow, height issue, erase issue!

- palette:
  status tiles: group first 8 colors
  change colors afterwards
  
  dual playfield
  * lower layer:
    - black/blue/green: 0
    - blue mountain, then change 2 colors for rocks
	  (recolor rock in those blue colors artficially): 1-2
	- green mountain, dark green or yellow (mountain/city) 3-4
	- orange (ground) reuse 3
	- brown (ground holes) reuse 4
	- white/yellow/dark red: 5-6-7 bomb explosions 
	  but pri problem vs jeep sprite, can be a non-problem
	  depending on the position of the green moutain!
	- reuse colors for volcanoes close to ground
	- change point color letters properly (below holes)
	
  * upper playfield
    - 8: wasted (transparent)
    - 9-10-11: blue/yellow/red for ships
	- 12: purple (bomb)
	- 13: white (hole bomb)
	- 9-10... rear missile is alone, reuse ship colors?
	- 14: red (explosions)
	- 15: green (in explosions)

- explosion which creates hole: right part looks wrong	
- if scrolling stops because player killed, should refresh
  actually if ground scrolling doesn't move it means that we should
  refresh background all the time (if dual playfield is not necessary after all)  
- find wrong clut yellow/red flashes
- ships not appearing is this a double buffering issue / try with immediate blitter: OK!!!
- most ground object colors are wrong
- insert coin screen: color bands not removed
- reuse 2 blue mountain colors for 2 lower scenery colors (rocks woulc be ideal!)
- remaining color bands (from start platform)
- moonbase colors not properly displayed
- 8373 contains 8C: use tiles palette, if not then switch, so moonbase has proper colors
- re-set tiles palette at some low Y so letters have proper palettes
- demo: moonbase displayed with trashed colors

solved if dual playfield used:
- vertical shot: tile, not sprite, conflicts with background
- (c) IREM not properly displayed
- when title displays (moon patrol), completely loses real time in cycle exact
  probably needs complete rethinking of what's done here / use backbuffer
  blitter refresh. Rest of game seems to run OK! Would require back to dual playfield!
  (object erase need mountains redraw at 50 fps which is probably too much)
- optimize bob erase below a given Y or within a given Y range
  (mountains erase, scrolling gound erases)
- small transparency effect on the tip of the "l" of "Moon Patrol" => BOGUS TITLE NOW

low pri:  
  
- declare tiles & cluts manually (with playfield info) to save memory
- optim: maybe only 2 planes could be needed for uniform ground
  (but there are letters...)


converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
