- make OCS version with lq sfx, no blue mountain?
- ECS version borderblank is gone even for AGA (whdload?)
- 99 credits after a while continuing
- highscore erased on section score screen
- "TIME" not displayed sometimes
- tip of brown rocks can be blue on slopes..: use sprites for rocks / rolling rocks
  if jeep is not exploding
- save highscore & best course times
- custom2 bit jump with button 2 only
- start lives is wrong
- update_bg_tile tweak to only copy last plane for some tiles (ground)
- still floor tile missing after a slope
- game is 10% slower than it should be. Adding extra call each 10 calls adds
  nothing but more problems (demo not in sync, title not in sync, who knows what?),
  and copper mid-screen interrupt system not working ATM. CIA hooks don't work either

AGA:

- blue mountain light blue color is wrong!
- borderblank not working???
- shot erase not working??
- ground strip mirror: missing 8 pixels, same for mountain strip
- add city layer: missing black color, redefine yellow
- reinstate dynamic green

- compare startup images with MAME
- dual playfield with characters on top except for lower strip >= 192 (if this can
  be dynamically switched 0x64 => 0x24 except in lower part!
- draw "moon patrol" characters in front? or just ignore them, we'll paste
  the image

- moon base almost ok (still color issues)



converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
