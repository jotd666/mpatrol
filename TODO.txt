- car body coords completely off, wheels seem ok
  check wheels sprite shadow how it's computed, relate
  to how body X,Y base is computed
- lockup on "insert coin" screen, typing effect seems
  not to work

- switch to dual playfield: this is not optimal as it leaves a 8 high blank space
  when it switches maybe because all the color & bitplane writes
  if possible, make game 100% dual playfield even status panel

- declare tiles & cluts manually (with playfield info)

tricks:

- use bobs palette for playfield (after status bar)
- "moon patrol" title displayed: switch to tiles palette for 8 first colors

- dual playfield: all 3 layers of ground, green & blue together, no scroll
- update green & blue not all the time (slow scroll)
- all bobs on the other plane
- sprites to complete the missing colors: map colors carefully
