- DONE! merge comments from z80 source of http://www.computerarcheology.com/Arcade/MoonPatrol/
- improve merge comments to issue replacement dict if instruction diff
  with variable insertion
- diff z80 codes and compute variable & function name replacement dict 
- rename variables too!
- during demo, jeep is killed almost at once (now crashes!)
- when "moon patrol" title is displayed, jeep is too low / jump looks bogus
- insert coin screen: color bands not removed
- insert coin OK but start game doesn't display moonbase, starts immediately like if it continued
- write_to_screen_03c9: eats first character ("I" of "INSERT COIN"

- (c) IREM not properly displayed
- small transparency effect on the tip of the "l" of "Moon Patrol" => BOGUS TITLE NOW
- moonbase colors not properly displayed

- 8373 contains 8C: use tiles palette, if not then switch, so moonbase has proper colors
- re-set tiles palette at some low Y so letters have proper palettes

- demo: bogus blocks (big hole looks ok)
- demo/start: moonbase not properly displayed
- check various heights vs arcade (title and in-game)

low pri:  
  
- declare tiles & cluts manually (with playfield info) to save memory
- optim: maybe only 2 planes could be needed for uniform ground
  or maybe even one (but there are letters...)


converter:

inc l, inc e => a0,a1...

recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
