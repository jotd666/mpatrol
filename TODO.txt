- 99 credits after a while continuing
- highscore erased on section score screen
- "TIME" not displayed sometimes
- tip of brown rocks can be blue on slopes..: use sprites for rocks / rolling rocks
  if jeep is not exploding
- save highscore & best course times
- custom2 bit jump with button 2 only
- start lives is wrong
- OCS: ground not working properly???
- borderblank ECS issue: maybe WinUAE problem??
- update_bg_tile tweak to only copy last plane for some tiles (ground)
- still floor tile missing after a slope
- game is 10% slower than it should be. Adding extra call each 10 calls adds
  nothing but more problems (demo not in sync, title not in sync, who knows what?),
  and copper mid-screen interrupt system not working ATM. CIA hooks don't work either
  

AGA:

- add city layer: missing black color, redefine yellow, height issue, 
   erase issue!
- blue mountain + ground strip on one playfield, using hardware scrolling
  => a lot less blits, with full bitplanes for ground strip (moonbase, maybe
     blit an adapted image because tile palette is still different, but tile
	 palette could be used for lower playfield, mountain colors could fit
     in or even be dynamic!)
- dual playfield with characters on top except for lower strip
- 

converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
