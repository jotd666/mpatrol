- continue screen timer doesn't work properly: time goes to 0 immediately, cannot continue
- queue_sound_effect_if_game_playing_0d75: game status bits not set properly!
- declare tiles & cluts manually (with playfield info) to save memory: almost ok
  missing ":" and pink / champion course status
- custom2 bit jump with button 2 only
- when mountains are not showing (clear screen called)
  remove copper change to let tile palette on the whole screen, set it if
  not set when displaying mountains

- update_bg_tile tweak to only copy last plane for some tiles (ground)
- optimize code by adding osd_w_videoram_no_update if followed by osd_w_colorram
- allow 2 non-rolling rocks as HW sprites to speed up
- loop sfx + music issue (ptplayer)

- toggle 25Hz if ECS, maybe 50Hz if AGA with fmode=3 and fastmem?
- after the flat section after rising slope (point R), when nb slope
  tiles change, rightmost scrolling tile is buggy, looks like
  a rodent's head or something... Same when mines...
- check hole-making ship animations / ovoid ships, look odd: probably flipx
- save highscore & best course times

- implement flipx int flipx = m_spriteram[offs + 1] & 0x40;
- check flipy??

- space plant flipx space plant in general looks hard to draw: snapshot the game at this point
- city layer: missing black color, redefine yellow, height issue, erase issue! ATM put mountain again
- explosion which creates hole: right part looks wrong	

- insert coin screen: color bands not removed


- (c) IREM not properly displayed + small transparency effect on the tip of the "l" of "Moon Patrol"
=> redraw more tiles!!!


low pri:  
  
- re-set tiles palette at some low Y so letters have proper palettes



converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
