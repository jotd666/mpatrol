- missile: miss front part if ships still in the sky (multiplexing sprite issue??)
- cycle exact: lower hardware sprites flash (multiplexing???)
- champion E: 10000 points (check on MAME on snapshot!!) bonus carry issue 10 of 10000 is trashed!
- champion cheat: car becomes pink sometimes
- 68000 test: crashes after first section in the middle of an instruction: re-test
  debug with chip slave
- ignore bob with y flip (hole making ship) instead of disappearing
  display normal bob
- dying & resuming with different mountain height! should erase blue mountain
  if previous y - y > 1 we should use blitter to clear zone or just
  better: clear top of screen if ground strip not moving
- write letter to 83DE: write into another buffer, then blit it at the proper location
  when blitting ground strip
  
- pre-render title and cookie cut blit (with proper bob palette if possible!) 
  it if "is_title_displayed", don't include "moon patrol" tiles

- custom2 bit jump with button 2 only
- start lives is wrong
- demo section out of sync jeep falls into second hole! then continues
- save highscore & best course times
- colons not erased: erase all planes when switching to mountains


- city layer: missing black color, redefine yellow, height issue, erase issue! ATM put mountain again


low pri:

- update_bg_tile tweak to only copy last plane for some tiles (ground)
- sprite allocation fail: low/high in message
- still floor tile missing after a slope

AGA:

- add city layer
- dual playfield with characters on top except for lower strip
- full bitplanes for ground strip (moonbase)

converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
