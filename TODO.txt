- sprite issue: multiplexing probably destroyed by constant reset_dynamic colors:
  rocks blink at start!!! reset_background_dynamic_colors/shift_d6_copper_y
  lwoer sprite copper area wrongly computed/wrongly skipped
- ground strip seems too low by 1 or 2 pixels or sprites are too high. Compare
 amiga/arcade on jeep startup
- continue timer doesn't decrease!
- sprite allocation fail: low/high in message
- demo section continues even if killed until game over then continue!!!
- champion panel missing tile cluts: test again!
- implement flipy (commented blitz atm) hole making ufos
- optimize code by adding osd_w_videoram_no_update if followed by osd_w_colorram
- custom2 bit jump with button 2 only
- add platform at startup even if mono-planar: merge all planes for those tiles
- 2-player startup doesn't work
- update_bg_tile tweak to only copy last plane for some tiles (ground)
- loop sfx + music issue (ptplayer)
- start lives is wrong
- green mountain not properly erased, we should erase at least lower part (let
  blue mountain do the rest)
- toggle 25Hz if ECS, maybe 50Hz if AGA with fmode=3 and fastmem?
- save highscore & best course times

- write letter to 83DE: write into another buffer, then blit it at the proper location
  when blitting ground strip

- check flipy??

- city layer: missing black color, redefine yellow, height issue, erase issue! ATM put mountain again

- (c) IREM not properly displayed + small transparency effect on the tip of the "l" of "Moon Patrol"
=> redraw more tiles!!!

- points awarded: 500 points wrong clut/wrong transcription because black color
  in sprite => set in background, OK as BOB

converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
