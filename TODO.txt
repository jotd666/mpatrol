- slope sections don't work properly: scrolling stutters, no slope tiles appear (demo)
  also point "P": change unknown_E1D8, E514 figure out what it is
  slope init could be wrong, slope update too at 188B
- continue screen timer doesn't work properly


graphical issues:

- palette:
  status tiles: group first 8 colors
  change colors afterwards
  
  dual playfield
  * lower layer:
    - black/blue/green: 0
    - blue mountain, then change 2 colors for rocks
	  (recolor rock in those blue colors artficially): 1-2
	- green mountain, dark green or yellow (mountain/city) 3-4
	- orange (ground) reuse 3
	- brown (ground holes) reuse 4
	- white/yellow/dark red: 5-6-7 bomb explosions 
	  but pri problem vs jeep sprite, can be a non-problem
	  depending on the position of the green moutain!
	- reuse colors for volcanoes close to ground
	- change point color letters properly (below holes)
	
  * upper playfield
    - 8: wasted (transparent)
    - 9-10-11: blue/yellow/red for ships
	- 12: purple (bomb)
	- 13: white (hole bomb)
	- 9-10... rear missile is alone, reuse ship colors?
	- 14: red (explosions)
	- 15: green (in explosions)
	
	
- find wrong clut yellow/red flashes
- ships not appearing is this a double buffering issue / try with immediate blitter: OK!!!
- after section E should be moon city and doesn't work
- most ground object colors are wrong
- insert coin screen: color bands not removed
- multiplex sprites with 2 sprite control copperlist zones (materialize it
  to debug): lower zone already busy with jeep+wheels (6 sprites, all color banks), upper zone
  would contain ufos
- reuse 2 blue mountain colors for 2 lower scenery colors (rocks woulc be ideal!)
- remaining color bands (from start platform)
- moonbase colors not properly displayed
- 8373 contains 8C: use tiles palette, if not then switch, so moonbase has proper colors
- re-set tiles palette at some low Y so letters have proper palettes
- demo: moonbase displayed with trashed colors

solved if dual playfield used:
- vertical shot: tile, not sprite, conflicts with background
- (c) IREM not properly displayed
- when title displays (moon patrol), completely loses real time in cycle exact
  probably needs complete rethinking of what's done here / use backbuffer
  blitter refresh. Rest of game seems to run OK! Would require back to dual playfield!
  (object erase need mountains redraw at 50 fps which is probably too much)
- optimize bob erase below a given Y or within a given Y range
  (mountains erase, scrolling gound erases)
- small transparency effect on the tip of the "l" of "Moon Patrol" => BOGUS TITLE NOW

low pri:  
  
- declare tiles & cluts manually (with playfield info) to save memory
- optim: maybe only 2 planes could be needed for uniform ground
  (but there are letters...)


converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
