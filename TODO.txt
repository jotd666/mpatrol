general:

- save highscore & best course times
- custom2 bit jump with button 2 only
- start lives is wrong
- game is 10% slower than it should be. Adding extra call each 10 calls adds
  nothing but more problems (demo not in sync, title not in sync, who knows what?),
  and copper mid-screen interrupt system not working ATM. CIA hooks don't work either
- still floor tile missing after a slope
- 99 credits after a while continuing

OCS:

- make OCS version with lq sfx, no blue mountain?

ECS:
- ECS version borderblank is gone even for AGA (whdload?)
- highscore erased on section score screen
- "TIME" not displayed sometimes
- tip of brown rocks can be blue on slopes..: use sprites for rocks / rolling rocks
  if jeep is not exploding
- update_bg_tile tweak to only copy last plane for some tiles (ground)

AGA:

- reinstate dynamic green: complete broken specially on moon city
- SPRITE_Y_SPLIT_LIMIT is now dynamic
- when ground is high, sprite multiplexing is limit clearly too high
- slope+moon city: garbled moon city!!!
- blue mountain a few characters top/left making a line... memwatch after blitting it???
- add city layer: missing black color if possible: caution!!! impact on ECS!!
- last letter not erased on "time to reach point".. screen / bitplane flashing issue
- borderblank not working???
- slowdowns chip only when UFOs attacking maybe use 30FPS too for BOBs in that case
- shots are red, should be white, swapping colors doesn't work!!!

- "game over" should be displayed on front layer (on mountains)



converter:


recognize pattern (maybe 68k pattern)

ld   a,l]
add  a,$10]
ld   l,a]

=> add.w	#$10,a0
