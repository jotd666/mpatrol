- wheels move but all wheels have the same Y
- when "moon patrol" title is displayed, jeep is too low
- lockup on "insert coin" screen, typing effect seems
  not to work

complete bogus update of
scroll_x_value_green_layer_E1C1
scroll_x_value_blue_layer_E1C2

- declare tiles & cluts manually (with playfield info)


tricks:

- use bobs palette for playfield (after status bar)
- "moon patrol" title displayed: switch to tiles palette for 8 first colors

- dual playfield: all 3 layers of ground, green & blue together, no scroll
- update green & blue not all the time (slow scroll)
- all bobs on the other plane
- sprites to complete the missing colors: map colors carefully
